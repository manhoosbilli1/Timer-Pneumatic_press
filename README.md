you gotta press up or down button in order to choose either minutes, seconds or 10th of a second (deci second) you can make a selection by clicking on mode button. once selection is confirmed the arrows will start to blink. you can then press up or down to increase or decrease the corresponding selection. i have programmed for the selection to time out if the user does not select the value within 30 seconds... we can increase or decrease that time in the code. once you are happy with the changes you can click on mode again to save your selection. it will let you know that i'ts saved successfully. similar is the way for seconds and 10th of seconds.. i have also programmed the arduino in such a way that once you've set the time.. if the controller is turned off it will remember the timer last chosen whenever it turns on again.
